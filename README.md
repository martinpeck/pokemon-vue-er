# Pokemon Vue-er

> A Vue.js based Pokemon app that allows you to vue (sic) the details of a given Pokemon.

## Introduction

This is a project that uses Vue.js to call the pokeapi.co API and display a small amount of information about a given Pokemon. I wrote this while reading some tutorials about Vue.js, so it's far from perfect.

There are a couple of useful packages being used here:

- [axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) is used to make API calls
- [vue-gh-pages](https://github.com/KieferSivitz/vue-gh-pages) is used to deploy to GitHub pages
- [bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) is used to add Bootstrap 4.0beta (not that I'm using this much)

A version of this app is deployed to Surge here...
